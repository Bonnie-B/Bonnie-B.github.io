**Abstract**

In this paper, we describe an investigation of mobile augmented reality (MAR) for facilitating 
assembly of structures designed by building information modeling (BIM). The goal of the 
project was to create a prototype tool that could overcome the most common mistakes at 
each of four stages in the assembly process as described by Hou et al.(2014) and develop a 
low-cost solution to translate geometry and data from a BIM to an AR environment.
